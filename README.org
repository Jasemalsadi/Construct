| For ExceptionHandler throws -- trap and display these in a nice way.   | TODO   |
| ~WshShell~ needs lots of attention (ENV VARS live here).               | TODO   |
| Add a built-in ~man~ or ~help~ command for usage within Construct.     | TODO   |

| Need to add support for saving output results to the local filesystem. | TODO   |

| Files in the ~winapi~ and ~runtime~ folders are scattered. Organise.   | TODO   |

| Add a command to GET/SET/SAVE/LOAD the Construct config (simple JSON). | TODO   |
